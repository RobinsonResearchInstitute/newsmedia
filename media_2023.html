    <p>Researchers at the Robinson Research Institute developed and installed the magnet used in the portable scanner, which is now being trialled in a joint project with the University of Minnesota in the United States.
      Ben Parkinson, a senior engineer at Robinson Research Institute, says the magnet's small size is the key to making MRI scanners portable. Smaller scanners will also mean "a more positive patient experience," he says.</p>

    <p>Paihau-Robinson Research Institute Professor Rod Badcock says that zero emission flights will have both an environmental impact, but also a major economic one.
      A large amount of New Zealand's GDP is spent purchasing oil from overseas, so switching to zero emission flights will give the economy a boost.</p>

    <img class="originalsize" src="img/2023/roadmap.jpg" alt="Screenshot of roadmap paper title.">
    <p>Doctors Dominic Mosely & Zhenan Jiang and Professors Rod Badcock & Mengjie Zhang of Victoria University have contributed to a new roadmap which lays out how AI and big data techniques could drive advances in superconductivity research and development is aiming to help to spark a tech revolution.</p>
    <button class="collapsible">Read more</button>
<div class="collapsed_content">
  <p>An international team of leading engineers, physicists, and computation scientists are behind the roadmap, which is the first of its kind for the field of AI for superconductor research. Dr Mohammad Yazdani-Asrami of the University of Glasgow, United Kingdom led the production of the roadmap, which is published as an invited paper in the Institute of Physics’ journal, Superconductor Science and Technology. </p>

   <p> The paper showcases 18 short articles, produced by 40 researchers from 26 institutions around the world. Together, they offer a comprehensive guide to how the power of machine learning could help overcome challenges which have held back the creation of new technologies built with superconducting components.</p>
    
    <p>Superconductors are a unique group of materials which can generate strong magnetic fields and transfer or store large amounts of energy. They are also capable of conducting electricity with zero resistance, a property which sets them apart from all other conductive materials, which lose energy as heat when current flows through them.</p>
    
    <p>Superconductors are currently used in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, which has enabled major advances in medical and cancer diagnostics by creating detailed scans of the body. They have also underpinned promising advancements in particle accelerators, energy storage and more. In the future, new superconductor technologies could also create breakthroughs in wind power generation, fusion energy, electric and hydrogen-powered transport, and aerospace applications helping the world achieve net-zero. </p>
    
    <p>However, a series of tough challenges have so far held back the widespread commercialisation of superconducting technology across the full spectrum of industries. Aside from MRIs, there are currently very few superconducting devices in commercial use, with many still confined to research facilities.</p>
    
    <p>Each section in the roadmap posits how new developments in AI and big data could help overcome problems currently holding back the development of specific areas of superconductor research.</p>
    
   <p> The team's paper, titled 'Roadmap on Artificial intelligence and big data techniques for superconductivity', is published in Superconductor Science and Technology and is available free of charge at <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6668/acbb34" target="_blank">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6668/acbb34</a> </p>
