<div class="collapsed_content">
  
  <p>Kyoto University and Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington have been holding annual workshops since 2014. These are organised by Victoria University of Wellington’s Paihau—Robinson Research Institute and Kyoto University's Faculty and Graduate School of Engineering.</p>

  <p>Kyoto University is a globally high-ranked university with 10 Nobel prize winners and Paihau—Robinson Research Institute is a global leader and trailblazer in superconductivity, material science, and electromagnetics.</p>

  <p>This year the workshop was held in Kyoto from 29-30 June. The host provided brilliant opportunities for a delegation from New Zealand to work together in the historical capital of Japan with dozens of fellow researchers and engineers.</p>
  <h3 class="centre vuw_green">Exploring recent breakthroughs in aircraft electrification, quantum computing, superconductivity, and more</h3>
  
  <p>The jam-packed two-day workshop covered recent discoveries and breakthroughs in areas like aircraft electrification, next-generation optoelectronics, quantum computing, superconductivity material science, and electromagnetics.</p>
  
  <p>The workshop covered a wide range of topics in materials science and superconductivity. It included studies on exotic forms of superconductivity, the use of phase change materials for heat storage, and the growth of quantum nanowires in organised patterns. Participants also discussed the creation of intrinsic diodes in superconducting materials, which could be used for valves and switches in current control. Another area of focus was the manipulation of electron spin in materials for information storage and processing. Additionally, the workshop explored the generation of THz radiation from layered superconductor materials and the use of ultrafast spectroscopy to study energy conversion in organic photovoltaics. The factors influencing the performance of organic photovoltaics and the application of photonics for quantum information processing were also discussed. In the realm of superconductivity, topics included increasing current levels in power supplies, developing motor-specific superconductor cables, utilising superconductivity in electric aircraft, and exploring the operation of superconductor magnets in space environments.</p>

  <p>For the organising institutes, this kind of collaboration is a way to ensure that their research is of the highest quality and has a robust and globally significant application.</p>
  
  <h3 class="centre vuw_green">Empowering research institutes for high-quality results and global impact</h3>

  <p>Workshop Chair and Director of Paihau—Robinson Professor Nick Long says, <q>Our approach was, from the very beginning, a bottom-up way to engage with the colleagues from Kyoto on a very personal level.</q></p>

  <q>Research does not happen in a vacuum but requires collaboration across different institutes, disciplines and researchers.</q> 
  
  <p>Paihau—Robinson’s Dr Zhenan Jiang is a testament to the success of this fruitful bottom-up approach. He completed his PhD with Professor Amemiya twenty years ago. The contacts he established during that time in Japan eventually led to the first workshop in 2014 and, subsequently, a formal Memorandum of Understanding between the universities in 2016.</p>

  <p>Principal Scientist Dr Zhenan Jiang, Dr Long, Professor Rod Badcock, Senior Scientists Dr Simon Granville and Dr James Storey from Paihau—Robinson Research Institute, and Professor Ulrich Zuelicke from Victoria University of Wellington’s School of Chemical and Physical Sciences participated in the June workshop in Kyoto.</p>
  
  <p>The workshop was like a superconductor of collaboration itself. Coming together in person makes ideas, news and views flow without resistance and friction. Sharing the recent findings, problems and visions speed up the research, improves the quality, and helps to maintain momentum. It is also a way to get research papers published in academic journals, build a case for funding and open opportunities for commercial partners to access the latest application of the science.</p>
  
<p>Professor Long explains, <q>This all means that we can accelerate the pace and achieve more in research.
  "Aircraft electrification, quantum computing, optical technologies, solar cell technologies, and fibre optic sensing technologies are the key to a sustainable future in many applications from transport to healthcare and from communication to space exploration.</q></p>

  <p>Dr Zhenan Jiang elaborates, <q>With our colleagues from Kyoto, we can make a huge difference. Those personal ties and connections bring more benefits to the global research community, and hopefully, this annual workshop has shown that one day the collaboration between these two universities can become even wider and deeper.</q></p>
  
  <p>Professor Long says, <q>Being a small but highly efficient and influential player in these emerging technologies makes us a sought-after partner and a highly desirable place for studies among the brightest young minds.</q></p>

  <q>We are small enough to be very nimble, quick, and responsive, yet big enough to be a global partner. The workshops with Kyoto University are just one example of our forward-looking strategy to significantly contribute to sustainability and the quality of life through science and human connections.</q>

    <img class="originalsize" src="img/2023/roadmap.jpg" alt="Screenshot of roadmap paper title.">
    <p>Doctors Dominic Mosely & Zhenan Jiang and Professors Rod Badcock & Mengjie Zhang of Victoria University have contributed to a new roadmap which lays out how AI and big data techniques could drive advances in superconductivity research and development is aiming to help to spark a tech revolution.</p>
    <button class="collapsible">Read more</button>
<div class="collapsed_content">
  <p>An international team of leading engineers, physicists, and computation scientists are behind the roadmap, which is the first of its kind for the field of AI for superconductor research. Dr Mohammad Yazdani-Asrami of the University of Glasgow, United Kingdom led the production of the roadmap, which is published as an invited paper in the Institute of Physics’ journal, Superconductor Science and Technology. </p>

   <p> The paper showcases 18 short articles, produced by 40 researchers from 26 institutions around the world. Together, they offer a comprehensive guide to how the power of machine learning could help overcome challenges which have held back the creation of new technologies built with superconducting components.</p>
    
    <p>Superconductors are a unique group of materials which can generate strong magnetic fields and transfer or store large amounts of energy. They are also capable of conducting electricity with zero resistance, a property which sets them apart from all other conductive materials, which lose energy as heat when current flows through them.</p>
    
    <p>Superconductors are currently used in magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, which has enabled major advances in medical and cancer diagnostics by creating detailed scans of the body. They have also underpinned promising advancements in particle accelerators, energy storage and more. In the future, new superconductor technologies could also create breakthroughs in wind power generation, fusion energy, electric and hydrogen-powered transport, and aerospace applications helping the world achieve net-zero. </p>
    
    <p>However, a series of tough challenges have so far held back the widespread commercialisation of superconducting technology across the full spectrum of industries. Aside from MRIs, there are currently very few superconducting devices in commercial use, with many still confined to research facilities.</p>
    
    <p>Each section in the roadmap posits how new developments in AI and big data could help overcome problems currently holding back the development of specific areas of superconductor research.</p>
    
   <p> The team's paper, titled 'Roadmap on Artificial intelligence and big data techniques for superconductivity', is published in Superconductor Science and Technology and is available free of charge at <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6668/acbb34" target="_blank">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6668/acbb34</a> </p>
