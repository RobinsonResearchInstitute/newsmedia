    <p>In scientific discovery, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is emerging as a new way to perceive and interpret the vast ocean of data that traditional methods might miss or misinterpret. Sofie Claridge's PhD research applies this transformative capability of AI to the phenomenon known as "quenching" in high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets.</p>

    <h2>Celebrating excellence — Emeritus Professor Bob Buckley</h2>
    <h5>3 May, Victoria University</h5>
    <img src="img/2024/bob_in_lab.jpg" alt="Bob Buckley in the lab.">
    <p>
      Throughout his career in material sciences, Emeritus Professor Buckley has focused on studying the behaviour of solid materials including semiconductors, sea ice, magnetic systems, and high-temperature superconductors (HTS). His research examines how these materials conduct electricity without resistance, their optical properties, and their responses to different temperatures.</p>

      Engineers  and scientists at Victoria University’s Paihau-Robinson Research  Institute are currently building a technology demonstration payload that  will launch to the International Space Station  (ISS) in 2025. The mission is named Hēki - te reo Māori for “egg” - and  will be housed on the ISS’ NanoRacks External Platform. Hēki will  demonstrate that a High-Temperature Superconducting magnet and its  wireless inductive power supply (called a “flux pump”)  can survive the journey to space and operate for long durations there.  The payload will be returned to Paihau-Robinson for post-flight  characterisation at the end of its time in space. </p>
