    <p>One of the coldest, hottest, and most powerful superconductor electric rocket thrusters ever to be tested in space is being built in a hi-tech shed at the bottom of Wainuiomata Hill.
  Next stop for the local tech is America, then the International Space Station - then maybe, one day, Mars.
  The superconductor magnet and its accompanying thruster is being assembled in Seaview, Lower Hutt. It will be checked in Houston, launched in Florida, and installed on the space station, where it must take its turn to get tested in space for the first time.</p>

      <p>High power electric motors and generators are a key piece of the electric aviation puzzle. Institute Principal Project Engineer Dr Grant Lumsden presented at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Electric Aircraft Technology Symposium (EATS) in Las Vegas.
         There he presented our concept design for a <a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2024-4042" target="_blank">10 MW partially superconducting generator</a> that can be directly coupled to a gas turbine for hybrid aircraft applications. It breaks through the 10 kW/kg barrier in this power class, and is very straightforward to manufacture, compared to many other proposals.

    <p>"Fusion Industry Association chief executive Andrew Holland is confident that at least one of the 45 competing fusion companies will nail it, and the impact will be revolutionary. Holland pays tribute to the innovation coming out of Wellington – an experimental direction called levitated dipole that differs from the more common magnetic confinement or inertial confinement technology. It uses the superconductor innovation of Te Herenga Waka Victoria University’s world-renowned Robinson Research Institute."

      Engineers  and scientists at Victoria University’s Paihau-Robinson Research  Institute are currently building a technology demonstration payload that  will launch to the International Space Station  (ISS) in 2025. The mission is named Hēki - te reo Māori for “egg” - and  will be housed on the ISS’ NanoRacks External Platform. Hēki will  demonstrate that a High-Temperature Superconducting magnet and its  wireless inductive power supply (called a “flux pump”)  can survive the journey to space and operate for long durations there.  The payload will be returned to Paihau-Robinson for post-flight  characterisation at the end of its time in space. </p>
