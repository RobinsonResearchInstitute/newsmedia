      <p>A team of scientists from the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, aims to reduce the space industry's reliance on traditional chemical rocket propulsion.
        The team is developing a new type of electric propulsion magnet. It is set to test the technology aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in the coming months.</p>

    <p>We welcomed a German delegation to our Sydney Street facility. Mr Christian Stertz, Divisional Manager for International Research Cooperation at the German Ministry of Education and Research, led the group in Wellington for bilateral science consultations between German and New Zealand officials.
      During the visit, exchange students Lukas Hamm and Adrian Voß from South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences presented their research from the past six months.
      It was an excellent opportunity to share our work and strengthen international collaborations in research and innovation.

    <p>In global academia, collaboration often comes laden with bureaucracy and formalities. Yet, the partnership between Paihau–Robinson Research Institute in New Zealand and South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences in Meschede in Germany exemplifies how informal, grassroots connections can yield extraordinary results. This enduring collaboration, which began in 2014 is a testament to the power of personal relationships and shared values in fostering meaningful academic and practical achievements.</p>
