    A rocket has launched to space carrying a magnet etched with a Māori design - making it a world-first.
    Professor Nick Long, director of the Robinson Research Institute, says there was a need to cover and protect the experiment, and so the idea was put forward that they could have a Māori design on it. 
    Launched in Florida a couple of days ago, it will make its way to the International Space Station (ISS), where scientists will study it.
